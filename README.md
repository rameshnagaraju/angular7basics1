# MyApp
1.components are the building blocks in Angular.
2.One of the first things we have to learn in Angular is how do components talk to each other.
3. First we create a component that accepts an fixed input, and prints it out.(A component that just prints "hello world" .)
4. Then, we make the input aa a variable,with one way binding.So the input message can now be changed programatically.
    ( A component that prints any given message. )
5.Then we explore how 2 components can talk to each other in both directions.(Banana in a box) .
